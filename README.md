# Prefix/Postfix Calculator

This is a simple **Pre/Postfix Calculator** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to input mathematical expressions in either **prefix** or **postfix** notation and evaluate them step-by-step. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`). It also provides an intuitive user interface with both light and dark mode themes.

## Installation

To get a copy of the project on your desktop, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saleh-Ghalayini/prefix-postfix-calculator.git
```

## How To Use:
  - enter the mathmetical expression using the buttons shown then either press enter or click on the equal sign (`=`) to start the evaluation.
  - you can switch between two evaluation methods:
    -  *Prefix* method that requires having the operators before the operands (e.g `+ 2 3` = `2 + 3` = `5`).
    -  *Postfix* method that requires having the operands before the operators (e.g `2 3 +` = `2 + 3` = `5`).
  -after entering a valid equation you can see the step by step answer in the solving process area.
  - you can switch between postfix and prefix using the post/prefix button.

## Technologies Used:
  - HTML: used to build the structure of the page that consists mainly of 4 parts the theme & pre/postfix buttons with the title and then 3 cards where each card has its own role in running the page.
  - CSS: gave the page a nice user-friendly experience that will make the user like the page while using it. And that was  done using the suitable colors that suit each other and the theme chagning feature as well.
    plus adding a bigger value with the responsivness of the page that makes it possible for desktop and mobile usage.
  - JavaScript: added the functionality to the page with the coding lines that were put in it to make the program run smoothly and achieving its goal.
    
## Key Features:
  - error handling which will prevent the user from many kinds of possible errors while keeping the program running if an error occoured like input invalidity and many others.
  - showing the step by step calculation that leads to the right answer.
  - the ease of reading andunerstanding the code since making it clean was taken underconsideration.
  - the smooth user experince that makes the page feel light during usage.
  - allowance of switching between light and dark theme to feel comfortable while using.
